# MTUOC-utils

A set of programs intended for users with no knowledge of Unix/Linux terminal. Each program performs some useful Unix commands or combination of programs for corpus processing. All the programs have a simple GUI interface and binaries for Windows and Mac are distributed in the latests releases.

## MTUOC-word-count

It counts lines, words and characters in text files. It can handle very large files. It performs the same process than Unix's

`wc file.txt`

although results may be slightly different.

The GUI interface asks for the file to process with the button **Select File**, and after selecting the file it shows the Lines, Words and Characters.

## MTUOC-file-viewer

It shows the content of text file and it can manage files of any size with no memory issues. It performs the same process thant the Unix's commands: `cat`, `more` and `tail`.

To use the program the file to be viewed should be selected with the button **Select file**. To see the content in a continuous manner use the button **Cat** and stop the view with the button **Stop**. You can see the file from the beginning with the button **More** and each time you click on this button the program will show the next lines. Reversely, to see the file from the end you can use the button **Tail**, and each time you click on this button the program will show the preceding lines.
